- 👋 Hi, I’m @Psithurial
- 👀 I’m interested in biotech and anything else metaclastic.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, C#, JS, Python, HTML+CSS+PHP, Bioinformatics, Biotech 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I'm interested in above.
- 📫 How to reach me, here.

-More: I'm an experienced fine-artist (all media) and graphic artist (Adobe and 3D CAD) learning more about programming and CS
        to improve my capabilities and take on more meainingful and satisfying work. I believe that humans are capable of so much
        that we leave unrealized and that if we break free of limiting paradigms we may be more than we thought was possible.

-Background: I was born and raised in a rural environment with little access to computer science education, but I have always been devoted
        to improving myself and gaining new knowledge and experiences. I have spent my adult life traveling the world
        to explore the human experience and expand my relationships with the lives and experiences of others.
